## Introduction
This section provides an overview of the PLL design project, its objectives, and its application in SerDes systems.

## Motivation
A sudden advancement in the semiconductor industry has resulted in technology scaling, which requires faster data rates and necessitates high-speed clocks in the multi-GHz range. With ever-increasing data rates, the I/O links need to scale appropriately to keep up with performance demands. Parallel links have not been able to match up with system performance. Thus, there is a need for Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) circuits, which further require PLLs for efficient data transmission. PLLs play a pivotal role in ensuring the accurate transmission of data across various interfaces by generating synchronized clock signals that minimize errors and maintain stability.
Therefore, the main motivation of this project is to overcome the barriers of complexity and provide an improved solution to the existing challenges in clock speed and stability within PLL systems, addressing the growing demands of high-performance technology.

## Objectives
1. Design a PLL capable of generating a stable and low-jitter clock signal to ensure reliable data transmission over high-speed serial links.
2. To achieve an output frequency more than 3 Ghz.
3. To implement and simulate each PLL component in Cadence Virtuoso  for functionality and parameter optimization.

## Theory and Background

### Overview of PLL
A Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is a negative feedback control system that generates a high- frequency output clock whose phase is related to the low-frequency input clock. The low- frequency clock can be generated using a crystal.

### Applications in SerDes
PLLs are critical in Serializer/Deserializer systems for generating stable clock signals, ensuring data integrity over high-speed communication channels. With skyrocketing data-rate interfaces, the need for clock frequencies in the multi-GHz range is paramount and requires the use of Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs). They are capable of generating high-frequency.

## Building Blocks 

### Phase Frequency Detector (PFD)
One of main blocks of PLL circuit is “Phase Frequency Detector ( P F D )”, which is the initial block of PLL circuit. It has two input ports one having input or reference signal whose phase and frequency to be locked is fed to PFD.

### Charge Pump
Charge pump converts the UP and DOWN signals generated by PFD into corresponding current values. Charge pump is followed by the loop filter. Charge pump either pumps current into loop filter or pump out the current from loop filter.
The main function of loop filter is to convert signal from PFD to a ripple free DC control voltage.We need to calculate the values of the capacitors and resistor in the loop filter, the zeros and the poles in the system as well as the charge pump current before implementing our design. This is done by first choosing the unity-gain bandwidth, phase margin and resistor.

### Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)
A Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) is an electronic oscillator whose oscillation frequency is controlled by an input voltage. VCOs are used in PLLs to generate precise and adjustable frequencies based on stable single frequency clock. It is implemented on the basis of barkhausen criteria.

### Frequency Divider
The frequency divider reduces the output frequency to maintain synchronization with the reference clock.
